							<div class="desc" style="text-align: justify;">In the late 1990s and early 21<sup>st</sup> century, a handful of scholars began to define and explore three social forms of regulation including self-regulation, co-regulation and shared regulation. Since that time, the field has rapidly burgeoned. This presentation will ground theory and research about social modes of regulation in their theoretical roots within educational psychology and the learning sciences identifying critical constructs underlyingour perspectives. Winne & Hadwin’s (1998) COPES model of self-regulated leaning will be extended to explain adaptive regulation in collaboration. Finally a decade of research will be summarized to illuminate progress, challenges and possibilities facing the field as we strive to model, research, and apply adaptive regulation in the context of dynamic collaborative learning contexts.</div>

										<b>Knowledge Tracing Using The Brain</b>

								<div class="collapse" id="halpern2018knowledge" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Knowledge tracing is a popular and successful approach to modeling student learning. In this paper we investigate whether the addition of neuroimaging observations to a knowledge tracing model enables accurate prediction of memory performance in held-out data. We propose a Hidden Markov Model of memory acquisition related to Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and show how continuous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals can be incorporated as observations related to latent knowledge states. We then show, using data collected from a simple second-language learning experiment, that fMRI data acquired during a learning session can be used to improve predictions about student memory at test. The fitted models can also potentially give new insight into the neural mechanisms that contribute to learning and memory.</div>
								<!-- <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Identifying struggling students in real-time provides a virtual learning environment with an opportunity to intervene meaningfully with supports aimed at improving student learning and engagement. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of quit prediction modeling in students playing a learning game called Physics Playground. From the interaction log data of the game, we engineered a comprehensive set of aggregated features of varying levels of granularity and trained individualized level-specific models and a single level-agnostic model. Contrary to our initial expectation, our results suggest that a level-agnostic model achieves superior predictive performance. We enhanced this model further with level-related and student-related features, leading to a moderate increase in AUC. Visualizing this model, we observe that it is based on high-level intuitive features that are generalizable across levels. This model can now be used in future work to automatically trigger cognitive and affective supports to motivate students to pursue a game level until completion.</div> -->

								<div class="collapse" id="sharma2018exploring" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">When students are working collaboratively and communicating verbally in a technology enhanced environment, the system is not aware of what collaboration is happening outside of the technology, making it difficult to adapt the system to better support the collaboration of the students. In this paper, we analyze the causal relationships between collaborative and individual gaze measures and the influence that the students dialogue, prior knowledge, or success has on these relationships to find indicators that can be used within an adaptive system. We found that when students are discussing concrete aspects of the problem, the causal relationship between their eye gaze measures changes compared to other types of dialogue patterns. The results also show a clear difference in causal relations when the pairs with high prior knowledge or success are compared with the pairs with low prior knowledge or success. Collaborative gaze causes the individual gaze for pairs with high prior knowledge and the opposite for the pairs with low prior knowledge.</div>

								<div class="collapse" id="kovanovic2018understand" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Reflective writing has been widely recognized as one of the most effective activities for fostering students' reflective and critical thinking. The analysis of students' reflective writings has been the focus of many research studies. However, to date this has been typically a very labor-intensive manual process involving content analysis of student writings. With recent advancements in the field of learning analytics, there have been several attempts to use text analytics to examine student reflective writings. This paper presents the results of a study examining the use of theoretically-sound linguistic indicators of different psychological processes for the development of an analytics system for assessment of reflective writing. More precisely, we developed a random-forest classification system using linguistic indicators provided by the LIWC and Coh-Metrix tools. We also examined what particular indicators are representative of the different types of student reflective writings.</div>

								<div class="collapse" id="jovanovic2019introducing" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">The use of learning trace data together with various analytical methods has proven successful in detecting patterns in learning behaviour, identifying student profiles, and clustering learning resources. However, interpretation of the findings is often difficult and uncertain due to a lack of contextual data (e.g., data on student motivation, emotion or curriculum design). In this study we explored the integration of student self-reports about cognitive load and self-efficacy into the learning process and collection of relevant students' perceptions as learning traces. Our objective was to examine the association of traced measures of relevant learning constructs (cognitive load and self-efficacy) with i) indicators of the students' learning behaviour derived from trace data, and ii) the students' academic performance. The results indicated the presence of association between some indicators of students' engagement with learning activities and traced measures of cognitive load and self-efficacy. Correlational analysis demonstrated significant positive correlation between the students' course performance and traced measures of cognitive load and self-efficacy.</div>

								<div class="collapse" id="motz2019validity" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Learning management system (LMS) web logs provide granular, near-real-time records of student behavior as learners interact with online course materials in digital learning environments. However, it remains unclear whether LMS activity indeed reflects behavioral properties of student engagement, and it also remains unclear how to deal with variability in LMS usage across a diversity of courses. In this study, we evaluate whether instructors' subjective ratings of their students' engagement are related to features of LMS activity for 9,021 students enrolled in 473 for-credit courses. We find that estimators derived from LMS web logs are closely related to instructor ratings of engagement, however, we also observe that there is not a single generic relationship between activity and engagement, and what constitutes the behavioral components of "engagement" will be contingent on course structure. However, for many of these courses, modeled engagement scores are comparable to instructors' ratings in their sensitivity for predicting academic performance. As long as they are tuned to the differences between courses, activity indices from LMS web logs can provide a valid and useful proxy measure of student engagement.</div>

										<b>Understanding Student Procrastination via Mixture Models</b>

								</ul>
								<div class="collapse" id="park2018understanding" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Time management is crucial to success in online courses in which students can schedule their learning on a flexible basis. Procrastination is largely viewed as a failure of time management and has been linked to poorer outcomes for students. Past research has quantified the extent of students' procrastination by defining single measures directly from raw logs of student activity. In this work, we use a probabilistic mixture model to allow different types of behavioral patterns to naturally emerge from clickstream data and analyze the resulting patterns in the context of procrastination. Moreover , we extend our analysis to include measures of student regularity-how consistent the procrastinating behaviors are-and construct a composite Time Management Score (TM). Our results show that mixture modeling is able to unveil latent types of behavior, each of which is associated with a level of procrastination and its regularity. Overall, students identified as non-procrastinators tend to perform significantly better. Within non-procrastinators, higher levels of regularity signify better performance, while this may be the opposite for procrastinators.</div>

										<b>An Open Vocabulary Approach for Estimating Teacher Use of Authentic Questions in Classroom Discourse</b>

									</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="collapse" id="cook2018open" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">Automatic assessment of the quality of classroom discourse can have a transformative effect on research and practice on improving teaching effectiveness. We improve on a previous automated method to measure teacher authentic questions -- open-ended questions without pre-scripted responses that predict student achievement growth -- using classroom audio and expert question codes from two sources: (1) a large archival database of text transcripts of 428 class-sessions from 116 classrooms, and (2) a newly collected sample of 132 high-quality audio recordings with automatic speech recognition transcripts from 27 classrooms. Whereas previous work utilized a "closed vocabulary" approach, consisting of 732 pre-defined word, sentence, and discourse level features, the present "open vocabulary" approach exclusively utilized word and phrase counts from the transcripts themselves. The two approaches yielded substantial, but statistically equivalent, correlations with gold-standard human codes of authenticity (Pearson r's of 0.396 vs. 0.424 and 0.602 vs. 0.613 for datasets 1 and 2, respectively). Importantly, averaging estimates from the two approaches resulted in statistically significant improvements over either approach (r's of 0.492 and 0.686 for datasets 1 and 2, respectively). We discuss implications of our findings for automated analysis of classroom discourse.</div>

								</ul>
								<div class="collapse" id="jiang2019goal" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">With cross-disciplinary academic interests increasing and academic advising resources over capacity, the importance of exploring data-assisted methods to support student decision making has never been higher. We build on the findings and methodologies of a quickly developing literature around prediction and recommendation in higher education and develop a novel recurrent neural network-based recommendation system for suggesting courses to help students prepare for target courses of interest, personalized to their estimated prior knowledge background and zone of proximal development. We validate the model using tests of grade prediction and the ability to recover prerequisite relationships articulated by the university. In the third validation, we run the fully personalized recommendation for students the semester before taking a historically difficult course and observe differential overlap with our would-be suggestions. While not proof of causal effectiveness, these three evaluation perspectives on the performance of the goal-based model build confidence and bring us one step closer to deployment of this personalized course preparation affordance in the wild.</div>

								</ul>
								<div class="collapse" id="shapiro2019integrative" style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">The development and use of computational approaches to make sense of data collected in collaborative learning contexts is expanding rapidly in the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) and Learning Sciences (LS) communities. However, developing and using these approaches in ways that maintain a commitment to theory and situational context is a significant challenge. This paper proposes integrative visualization, a computationally assisted, human-centered process to visually explore data collected in collaborative learning contexts in a way that maintains a commitment to theory and situational context. To do so, this paper summarizes how integrative visualization supported the development and use of interaction geography, an approach to describing, representing, and interpreting collaborative interaction across the physical environment. This paper concludes by emphasizing the need to further develop integrative visualization in the CSCL and LS communities through stronger connections with the information visualization community.</div>

						<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Allyson Hadwin is a Full Professor in the Department of Educational Psychology and Leadership Studies at the University of Victoria and co-director of CFI/BCKDF-funded Technology Integration and Evaluation (TIE) Research Lab. Her work focuses on: (a) theoretical modelling of self-regulation and regulation in collaborative learning contexts, and (b) examining instructional tools and technologies for promoting metacognitive awareness and adaptive regulation. Her research team draw from multiple methodologies to explore the dynamic and social nature of regulated learning as it evolves over time and through interaction with others. They are particularly interested in learning analytics that promote student success by providing information for learners about their own adaptive or maladaptive regulation.</p>
